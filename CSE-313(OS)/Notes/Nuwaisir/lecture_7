Lecture-7:
hard disk has logical partitioning
section 0 of the disk has MBR(Master Boot Record), it executes first.
Active partition hishebe 1 ta parition marked thake. jeta active shetar moddhe

Implementing flies:
- Contiguous allocation (valo performance, principal of locality)
    -principal of locality -> ekhon jeta access kortesi, er ashepasher element
    nikot vobisshote abar access howar chance high.
    ekhetre ek bar disk read kore ekta file fast read kora jay purata, Contiguous
    na hoile bar bar read kora lagto, so time beshi lagto
    but most systems do not use this kind of file Implementation (Contiguous)
    Case : Defragmentation(etar mane ki sure how) -> file er kono block delete 
    hoile memory te hole toiri hobe.
    Case : emon system jetay, ekbar write korle ar kono change kori na, shetay
    contiguous allocation kora hoy, jemon CD te, karon ekhane delete kora lage na

- Linked List allocation:
    -Linked list of file blocks. 
    shubidha: 
    - No memory holes. every block usable.
    - Only need to stroe first block
    oshubidha:
    - poor random access
    - pointer er jonno jayga chere dite hocche for each block
      tai block size not a power on 2

- linked list allocation with in-memory(RAM e) table:
     This is FAT system
    - store the pointers in memory ( i -> p[i] -> p[p[i]] -> ... )
    - this will enable us to use power of 2 for block size.

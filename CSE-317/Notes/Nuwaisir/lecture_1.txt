Adversarial Search:
Multiple agents operates in the same field.

Typical Assumptions:
1. Two agents whose actions alternate.
2. One agent tries to create adverse situtation for the other agent
3. Environment is fully observable
4. see slide...

Search vs Games:
Search - no adversary, Games - adversary
see slide.

For games, strategy may change depending on the function of the opponent
For search, finding optimal solution is easy, as no adversary thing is there.
For games, as there is a time limit, approximate solution is found.
Evaluation function evaluates goodness of the game position.

slide 4:
"Chance" mean: not deterministic (maybe luck)
"Imperfect information" means: opposite agent doesn't know one's state. So, imperfection is inevitable.

Max Min Game:
It is a category of games.
Two players play, one is MAX and other is MIN. They takes turns alternately. MAX goes first. 
Max tries to score as much as possible, and MIN tries to minimize that.

One example is tic tac toe game :)

branching factor: How many branches generate from a node.
number of moves by both player: depth of the search tree.
Search tree size : b^d
